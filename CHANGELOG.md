## Version 2.0.0 - 2015/02/24

This is a full rewrite of this plugin and it is not backwards compatible with previous versions. We did that in order to have:

1. Simplified configuration: now it just exposes the HikariCP properties which can be configured directly in `conf/application.conf` file
2. Better documentation: it is more clear, concise and direct
3. Automated tests: now we have a specs suite
4. Java 8 support
