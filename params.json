{"name":"play-hikaricp","tagline":"HikariCP Plugin for Play 2.2.x and 2.3.x","body":"# HikariCP Plugin for 2.3.x\r\n\r\n> This plugin is not necessary for applications using using **Play 2.4.0** because HikariCP is [the default pool for Play 2.4.0](https://playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/Highlights24#HikariCP). Anyway, we will try to keep this plugin updated with HikariCP releases to support developers using Play 2.3.x.\r\n\r\nThis plugin works with `2.3.x` of PlayFramework and uses version `2.3.8` of HikariCP.\r\n\r\nNote, it can be made to work with Play `2.2.x` (or 2.3.x) of the PlayFramework, but it requires changing the dependencies as the current build relies on the Play `2.3.x` plugin. Please, see the versions table below to see which version of Play is supported.\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com) [![Issue Stats](http://issuestats.com/github/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com/badge/pr)](http://issuestats.com/github/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com) [![Dependency Status](https://www.versioneye.com/user/projects/54eaa687d1ec577c97000cd5/badge.svg?style=flat)](https://www.versioneye.com/user/projects/54eaa687d1ec577c97000cd5) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com?branch=master) [![Codacy Badge](https://www.codacy.com/project/badge/9817a5d0538b434eb052ce5917a7ae9d)](https://www.codacy.com/public/contact_4/play-hikaricp.edulify.com)\r\n\r\n## About this documentation\r\n\r\nWhen reading this documentation at Github, select the tag that matches the version of the plugin that you are using.\r\n\r\n## Why HikariCP?\r\n\r\n[HikariCP](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP) is supposed to be the fastest connection pool in Java land. But we did not start to use it because of speed, but because of its reliability. After suffering with connection leaks from BoneCP, we decide to implement our own database plugin to replace the default one. You can see [a discussion about database exceptions](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/play-framework/7PBnjiXkNuU) caused by BoneCP (or misconfiguration of it). Also there are numerous other discussions about people having problems related to BoneCP.\r\n\r\nHere is how HikariCP is working for us:\r\n\r\n![HikariCP in Production](http://i.imgur.com/xPqkc7T.png)\r\n\r\n## Versions\r\n\r\n| Version | HikariCP | Play  | Docs reference                   |\r\n|--------:|---------:|------:|:---------------------------------|\r\n| 2.1.0   | 2.4.3    | 2.3.10 | [Release 2.1.0](https://github.com/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com/blob/2.1.0/README.md)|\r\n| 2.0.6   | 2.3.8    | 2.3.9 | [Release 2.0.6](https://github.com/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com/blob/2.0.6/README.md)|\r\n| 2.0.5   | 2.3.7    | 2.3.8 | [Release 2.0.5](https://github.com/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com/blob/2.0.5/README.md)|\r\n| 2.0.4   | 2.3.6    | 2.3.8 | [Release 2.0.4](https://github.com/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com/blob/2.0.4/README.md)|\r\n| 2.0.3   | 2.3.5    | 2.3.8 | [Release 2.0.3](https://github.com/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com/blob/2.0.3/README.md)|\r\n| 2.0.2   | 2.3.2    | 2.3.8 | [Release 2.0.2](https://github.com/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com/blob/2.0.2/README.md)|\r\n| 2.0.1   | 2.3.2    | 2.3.8 | [Release 2.0.1](https://github.com/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com/blob/2.0.1/README.md)|\r\n| 2.0.0   | 2.3.2    | 2.3.8 | [Release 2.0.0](https://github.com/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com/blob/2.0.0/README.md)|\r\n| 1.5.2   | 2.3.2    | 2.3.8 | [Release 1.5.2](https://github.com/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com/blob/1.5.2/README.md)|\r\n| 1.5.1   | 2.2.5    | 2.3.7 | [Release 1.5.1](https://github.com/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com/blob/1.5.1/README.md)|\r\n| 1.5.0   | 2.0.1    | 2.3.4 | [Release 1.5.0](https://github.com/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com/blob/1.5.0/README.md)|\r\n| 1.4.1   | 2.0.1    | 2.3.2 | [Release 1.4.1](https://github.com/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com/blob/1.4.1/README.md)|\r\n| 1.4.0   | 1.4.0    | 2.3.1 | [Release 1.4.0](https://github.com/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com/blob/1.4.0/README.md)|\r\n| 1.3.1   | 1.3.8    | 2.3.1 | [Release 1.3.1](https://github.com/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com/blob/1.3.1/README.md)|\r\n| 1.3.0   | 1.3.8    | 2.3.1 | [Release 1.3.0](https://github.com/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com/blob/1.3.0/README.md)|\r\n| 1.2.0   | 1.3.8    | 2.2.3 | [Release 1.2.0](https://github.com/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com/blob/1.2.0/README.md)|\r\n| 1.1.0   | 1.3.8    | 2.2.3 | [Release 1.1.0](https://github.com/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com/blob/1.1.0/README.md)|\r\n| 1.0.0   | 1.3.5    | 2.2.2 | [Release 1.0.0](https://github.com/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com/blob/1.1.0/README.md)|\r\n\r\nFor more information about what changed in each version, see the CHANGELOG.md file.\r\n\r\n## Repository\r\n\r\nYou need to add the following repository in order to use this module:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nresolvers += Resolver.url(\"Edulify Repository\", url(\"https://edulify.github.io/modules/releases/\"))(Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How to Use\r\n\r\nThere are just a few steps to properly configure the plugin:\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Add the dependency\r\n\r\nAdd the following dependency to your `project/build.sbt` or `project/Build.scala`:\r\n\r\n    \"com.edulify\" %% \"play-hikaricp\" % \"2.1.0\"\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Disable default `dbplugin`\r\n\r\nAdd the following line to your `conf/application.conf`:\r\n\r\n    dbplugin=disabled\r\n\r\nThis will disable `dbplugin` and avoids that BoneCP creates useless connections (which in some cases can create database problems, like exhaust available connections).\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Enable HikariCP Plugin\r\n\r\nAdd the following line to your `conf/play.plugins`:\r\n\r\n    200:com.edulify.play.hikaricp.HikariCPPlugin\r\n\r\nDue to the fact that the [Play JPA plugin](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/master/framework/src/play-java-jpa/src/main/resources/play.plugins) is assigned a priority of **400**, please make sure that you assign `com.edulify.play.hikaricp.HikariCPPlugin` a priority less than that when using datasources looked up via JNDI. Otherwise, during application startup when JPA attempts to create the `EntityManagerFactory` your data source will not have been bound to JNDI yet. [Play documentation](http://playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/ScalaPlugins) states that connection pools should use a **200** priority.\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Configure HikariCP\r\n\r\nPlease, before reading this section, we recommend that you get familiarized with [HikariCP configurations](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP#configuration-knobs-baby). It is the main source to understand each possible configuration for HikariCP and it have invaluable information about how to best configure your pool. We also recommends that you read about [Typesafe Config](https://github.com/typesafehub/config), which is the configuration language used by PlayFramework.\r\n\r\nThis plugin just read each possible HikariCP configuration and create the pool from it, with all the defaults honored. Here is a simple example of how to configure your pool in `application.conf`:\r\n\r\n    db {\r\n      default {\r\n        driverClassName=org.postgresql.Driver\r\n        jdbcUrl=\"jdbc:postgresql://localhost/simpsons\"\r\n        username=bart\r\n        password=51mp50n\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can configure it using some implementation of `javax.sql.DataSource` provided by your JDBC Driver:\r\n\r\n    db {\r\n      default {\r\n        dataSourceClassName=org.postgresql.ds.PGSimpleDataSource\r\n        dataSource {\r\n          user=bart\r\n          password=51mp50n\r\n          databaseName=springfield\r\n          serverName=localhost\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHikariCP documentation has a [list of JDBC DataSource classes for popular databases](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP#popular-datasource-class-names). Both `dataSourceClassName` and `jdbcUrl` are supported, but HikariCP recommends the former. Also, you can configure more than one database:\r\n\r\n    db {\r\n\r\n      default {\r\n        dataSourceClassName=org.postgresql.ds.PGSimpleDataSource\r\n        dataSource {\r\n          user=bart\r\n          password=51mp50n\r\n          databaseName=springfield\r\n          serverName=localhost\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      orders {\r\n        dataSourceClassName=org.postgresql.ds.PGSimpleDataSource\r\n          dataSource {\r\n            user=homer\r\n            password=duffbeer\r\n            databaseName=orders\r\n            serverName=localhost\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n## Log SQL statements\r\n\r\nHikariCP does not offer (out of the box) a way to log SQL statements and it suggests that you use the log capacities of your database vendor. From HikariCP docs:\r\n\r\n> **Log Statement Text / Slow Query Logging**\r\n>\r\n> Like Statement caching, most major database vendors support statement logging through properties of their own driver. This includes Oracle, MySQL, Derby, MSSQL, and others. Some even support slow query logging. We consider this a \"development-time\" feature. For those few databases that do not support it, jdbcdslog-exp is a good option. Great stuff during development and pre-Production.\r\n\r\nWe take the suggestion of using [jdbcdslog-exp](https://code.google.com/p/jdbcdslog-exp/) and have implemented SQL log statement support, which can be configured by database, using `logSql` property:\r\n\r\n    db {\r\n      default {\r\n\r\n        logSql=true\r\n\r\n        dataSourceClassName=org.postgresql.ds.PGSimpleDataSource\r\n        dataSource {\r\n          user=bart\r\n          password=51mp50n\r\n          databaseName=springfield\r\n          serverName=localhost\r\n\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAfter that, you can configure the jdbcdslog-exp [log level as explained in their manual](https://code.google.com/p/jdbcdslog/wiki/UserGuide#Setup_logging_engine). Basically, you need to configure your root logger to `INFO` and then decide what jdbcdslog-exp will log (connections, statements and result sets). Here is an example using `conf/application.conf` to configure the logs:\r\n\r\n    logger.root=INFO\r\n    logger.org.jdbcdslog.ConnectionLogger=ERROR # won't log connections\r\n    logger.org.jdbcdslog.StatementLogger=INFO   # log all statements\r\n    logger.org.jdbcdslog.ResultSetLogger=ERROR  # won't log result sets\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that **this is intended to be used just in development environments** and you should not configure it in production, since there is a performance degradation and it will polute your logs.\r\n\r\n## JNDI Support\r\n\r\nThanks to contributions from the community, this plugin supports to bind a DataSource to a JNDI context. Here is an example of how to add configure it in `conf/application.conf`:\r\n\r\n    db {\r\n      default {\r\n\r\n        jndiName=\"DefaultDataSource\"\r\n\r\n        dataSourceClassName=org.postgresql.ds.PGSimpleDataSource\r\n        dataSource {\r\n          user=bart\r\n          password=51mp50n\r\n          databaseName=springfield\r\n          serverName=localhost\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n## Using with Slick\r\n\r\n[play-slick](https://github.com/playframework/play-slick) requires a `db.<database>.driver` property to be configured. So, besides your pool configuration, when using Slick, you also have to configure this property. Per instance:\r\n\r\n    db {\r\n      default {\r\n        driver=org.postgresql.Driver\r\n        driverClassName=${db.default.driver}\r\n        jdbcUrl=\"jdbc:postgresql://localhost/simpsons\"\r\n        username=bart\r\n        password=51mp50n\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNotice that the driver was repeated in two different properties, even if one is reference the other. After that, play-slick is smart enough to use the configured pool.\r\n\r\n## Deploying to Heroku\r\n\r\nWhen using Heroku, a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in the form `scheme://user:password@host:port/db` will be created for you. This variable can be used directly inside `application.conf`:\r\n\r\n    db {\r\n      default {\r\n        driverClassName=org.postgresql.Driver\r\n        databaseUrl=${DATABASE_URL}\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nYou can see a full list of contributors [here](https://github.com/edulify/play-hikaricp.edulify.com/graphs/contributors). Thank you very much to all the people that helps us to maintain and evolve this plugin.\r\n\r\n## Inspirations and Alternatives\r\n\r\nThe code here is highly inspired by the following plugins:\r\n\r\n1. [swaldman/c3p0-play](https://github.com/swaldman/c3p0-play)\r\n2. [autma/play-hikaricp-plugin](https://github.com/autma/play-hikaricp-plugin)\r\n\r\nWe decide to do our own because both plugins above looks unmaintained.\r\n\r\nThere are also two other alternatives using c3p0:\r\n\r\n1. [hadashi/play2-c3p0-plugin](https://github.com/hadashi/play2-c3p0-plugin)\r\n2. [Furyu/play-c3p0-plugin](https://github.com/Furyu/play-c3p0-plugin)\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n1.
